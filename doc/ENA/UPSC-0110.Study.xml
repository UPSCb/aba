   <STUDY_ABSTRACT>ABA is a major regulator of dormancy. To understand the role of ABA in dormancy regulation, we generated ABA insensitive hybrid aspen plants. Control wild type and abi1-1 plants were subject to 0, 6 and 10 weeks of short days and apices were collected. RNA was isolated from these and RNA was subjected to RNAseq and gene expression changes were analysed at 0-6 and 6 -10 weeks in the wild type and then these genes were analysed for their expression in abi1-1 plants.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
